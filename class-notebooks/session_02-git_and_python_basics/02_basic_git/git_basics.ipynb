    "**remote** - a remote is an external repository that the local repository syncs with.  A given repository can have more than one remote.  Standard remotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- origin -- default remote repository (i.e, the GitLab repo if you clone a repository from gitlab)\n",
    "\n",
    "**branch** - a branch is a set of code changes that are kept separate from the main code base (or trunk) in a git repository.  A branch can be worked on in isolation until one wants to merge the changes back into the trunk.  Git makes it easy to create branches both in your local repository and in a remote.  Standard branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- master -- default development branch\n",
    "- HEAD   -- current branch\n",
    "- HEAD^  -- parent of head\n",

    "```\n",
    "git clone git://host.org/myproject.git # an external GitHub Repo though HTTPS\n",
    "git clone ssh://you@somehost.org/project.git # through SSH\n",

    "\n",
    "## Stashing - Moving changes to the side\n",
    "\n",
    "The `git stash` command lets you put aside a set of changes so that you can pull updated code from a remote.  You can then either re-apply your stash of changes to the updated code files or discard them.\n",

    "## GitHub Flow\n",

    "of your project. You can think of it as an undo button, a lab notebook, and a tool to safely and efficiently collaborate with others on a shared project, all rolled into one.\n",
    "All serious software projects use version control.\n",

    "(e.g., source code, $\\LaTeX$  files).\n",
